PyQt is a Python binding for Qt, which is a set of C++ libraries and development tools that include platform-independent abstractions for Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), as well as networking, threads, regular expressions, SQL databases, SVG, OpenGL, XML, and many other powerful features. Developed by RiverBank Computing Ltd, PyQt is available in two editions:

1. PyQt4: an edition that’s built against Qt 4.x and 5.x
2. PyQt5: an edition that’s only built against Qt 5.x

PyQt5 is based on Qt v5 and includes classes that cover Graphical User Interfaces as well as XML handling, network communication, regular expressions, threads, SQL databases, multimedia, web browsing, and other technologies available in Qt. PyQt5 implements over one thousand of these Qt classes in a set of Python modules, all of which are contained within a top-level Python package called PyQt5.

PyQt5 is compatible with Windows, Unix, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android. This can be an attractive feature if you’re looking for a library or framework to develop multi-platform applications with a native look and feel on each platform.
